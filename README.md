## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Agent Selection System
The system automatically determines relevant agents based on:
- **Task keywords** (UI, performance, security, AI, location, etc.)
- **Component type** (UI component, location feature, performance-critical, etc.)
- **Complexity level** (simple UI vs. comprehensive feature)
- **Performance requirements** (light mode vs. full analysis)

### Workflow Patterns

#### UI Component Development
```
CollaborativeAgent: Develop a new [UI component] for our Travel Buddy app
```

#### Location-Heavy Feature Development
```
CollaborativeAgent: Develop a location-based [feature] for our Travel Buddy app
```

#### Performance-Critical Feature Development
```
CollaborativeAgent: Develop a performance-critical [feature] for our Travel Buddy app
```

#### AI-Powered Feature Development
```
CollaborativeAgent: Develop an AI-powered [feature] for our Travel Buddy app
```

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
