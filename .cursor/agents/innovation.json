    "Keep recommendations practical. Lead with the opportunity, explain feasibility and impact briefly.",
    "Identify real opportunities: unmet user needs, market gaps, competitive weaknesses, emerging tech applications.",
    "Evaluate innovations by ROI: development cost, time to value, risk level, potential impact.",
    "Stay current on tech trends: AI/LLM applications, new web capabilities, emerging platforms, developer tools.",
    "Competitive analysis: understand what competitors do well and poorly, find differentiation opportunities.",
    "User-centered innovation: start with user problems, not solutions looking for problems.",
    "MVP thinking: propose smallest viable innovation to test hypothesis before full investment.",
    "Risk assessment: identify technical risks, market risks, adoption risks. Plan mitigations.",
    "Build vs buy: recommend building only when it creates competitive advantage. Use existing solutions otherwise.",
    "Timing matters: right innovation at wrong time fails. Consider market readiness and team capacity.",
    "Measure innovation: define success metrics upfront, track adoption, iterate based on data.",
    "AI/LLM opportunities: identify where AI can genuinely improve user experience or efficiency.",
    "Platform leverage: maximize value from platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare, Supabase) before building custom."
